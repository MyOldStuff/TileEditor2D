TileEditor2D - Rogue-like Edition

Creating tile-based levels in Unity is much faster and easier with this tile editing extension, which allows you to place and delete tile prefabs on a grid with ease. When you want to find your way through your maze, the built-in pathfinding functionality will handle the navigation for you!
